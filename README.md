#Elixir Guessing Game

## A simple command line game that will solidify some of the core fundamentals of the language including:
### User Input
### Data Type Conversion
### String Concatenation and Interpolation
### Control Flow
### Randomizing an Integer

## Issues I came across when following this tutorial: http://elixirdose.com/post/Guessing%20Game%20v2
  ### There was no documentation or explanation of how to require modules from different modules.
    ### "Code.require("path_to_file")" - for some reason this solution was hard to find
  ### Need to study more about Binaries, Strings, Lists, etc.
    ### The function "binary_to_integer" was not working, however, "String.to_integer" worked.
    ### Need to explore UTF-8 and Unicode and how Elixir breaks things down to put it simply
